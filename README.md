# Neural Network Visualization
This is a repository containing the source code for the animations shown in [A Visual Introduction to Neural Networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCqjCAbd5E&t=19s). 

# Requirements
These animations were made using the Python mathematical animation library - [Manim](https://docs.manim.community/en/v0.2.0/). 

# Acknowledgements
Special thanks to [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw) for the inspiration behind these animations, and to the Manim Community for the constant support.
